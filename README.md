ABSTRACT
We made a portable color memorization game where the players must remember the sequence of the flashing colors in the correct order. It is based off a popular portable toy in the late 70’s  called “Simon”. Ours includes an LCD screen where you can keep track of your current score, while also displaying the high score before the game starts.
